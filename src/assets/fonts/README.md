# PDF Generation Fonts

This directory was intended for custom fonts for PDF generation. However, to simplify the implementation and avoid build issues, we now use the default fonts provided by the jsPDF library.

## Default Fonts Available in jsPDF

- helvetica (normal, bold, italic, bolditalic)
- courier (normal, bold, italic, bolditalic)
- times (normal, bold, italic, bolditalic) 
- zapfdingbats

These fonts are built into the PDF standard and are guaranteed to work without the need for external font files.
